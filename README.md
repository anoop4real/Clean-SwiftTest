# Clean-SwiftTest
A sample project to try out the cleanswift architecture. Not sure whether I understood it fully, anyways I wrote it.

Here is my thought.
1. There are a lots of components/ file need to be taken care of.
2. Sometimes I feel I am writing redundant code.
3. Request structures are simply passed eventhough it is empty.
4. Complex usecases will be hard to implement I guess.

Note: Someone who is best at cleanswift can review this and let me know.
